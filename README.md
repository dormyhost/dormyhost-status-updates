## Dormyhost status posts

We are glad to restore [dormy.host](https://dormy.host) in the initial state as if nothing happened. Please do not worry about production state of the service: currently the backup and the service implementation are in active development so 1. in future we will be able to restore services faster 2. certainly won't _try things_ when real customers have their websites hosted with us. Thank you for your understanding

We regret to inform you that [dormy.host](https://dormy.host) encountered severe OS issue caused by an attempt to free disk space. Currently websites work, however OS reinstallation is required during which a downtime is expected. Luckily, we don't have any customers yet, so there won't be any negative impact.

We regret to inform you that [dormy.host](https://dormy.host) is currently undergoing a maintenance caused by the degradation of the underlying hardware of Amazon EC2 instance that we use. It is a rare event, so we will need some time in order to resolve the situation. This status will be updated during the next 24 hours.
Please note that our services use different infrastructure, so **no negative impact** is present for the existing customers.
