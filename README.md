## Dormyhost status posts

We are glad to restore [dormy.host](https://dormy.host) in the initial state as if nothing happened. Please do not worry about production state of the service: currently the backup and the service implementation are in active development so 1. in future we will be able to restore services faster 2. certainly won't _try things_ when real customers have their websites hosted with us. Thank you for your understanding

We regret to inform you that [dormy.host](https://dormy.host) encountered severe OS issue caused by an attempt to free disk space. Currently websites work, however OS reinstallation is required during which a downtime is expected. Luckily, we don't have any customers yet, so there won't be any negative impact.
